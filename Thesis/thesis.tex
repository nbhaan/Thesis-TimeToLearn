\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent 

Learning has changed over the years. People do not learn only from books anymore. Although Books are still used, other tools for learning are gaining popularity. Websites that can test the knowledge about words of another language of the user are quit common and they have improved themselves over the years.

There is however a disadvantage. The user still needs to find the time to sit down in front of the screen and focus to learn the words. With the upcoming market of smartwatches a new possibility for learning is created. A possibility that makes the user able to learn words whenever the user wants to. 

The smartwatch is however a relatively new platform with a small screen and thus we had to investigate what is the best way to build an app for the smartwatch. And can an app for the smartwatch help to accelerate the memorization process of somebody who is learning the vocabulary of a second language?

The app is useful for busy people who can read and understand the language, but want to improve their vocabulary by reading articles in this language and selecting the words the user did not know. These words can be learned by the smartwatch app to improve their vocabulary. 
The smartwatch is a suitable solutation, because it is quickly accessible which makes it ideal for situations like waiting for and waiting in the elevator or waiting for the bus or other situations where time is lost by waiting. The user only has to twist his or her wrist to continue learning. This is the reason why it is more convenient to use than an app for the smartphone. It is much more easier to access the app on the watch than on a smartphone.

Applications that are built with the same motivation as our app are mostly built for a smartphone like an Android wallpaper. Our approach is different, because we are going to try to use a smartwatch.

Several users have used the app for five days and they provided us with results and feedback.
